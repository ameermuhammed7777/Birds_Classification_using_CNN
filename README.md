# Birds_Classification_using_CNN

This project is a bird species prediction model utilizing both Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for target data analysis and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for birds species prediction,trained on a dataset containing 750 birds images across 5 species.Here,we compare predicted data with original data to validate the model's accuracy against the original dataset.
